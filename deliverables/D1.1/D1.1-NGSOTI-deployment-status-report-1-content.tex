\chapter{NGSOTI setup and operation}
In the NGSOTI project, the consortium closely monitored the behavior and requirements of its user communities, ensuring the development and customization of tools tailored to support efficient SOC operations. These tools are detailed in the following section.

\section{Optimized Tools for Streamlined SOC Operations}


\subsection{Tenzir}


\subsection{SkillAegis}
SkillAegis is an excellent outcome of the NGSOTI project, aligning seamlessly with its mission to train the next generation of Security Operations Center (SOC) operators. While the project emphasizes creating operational infrastructures and fostering hands-on training environments, SkillAegis addresses the critical human element by providing a platform for scenario-based training.
SkillAegis equips trainees with practical skills to navigate these challenges by simulating real-world incidents in a controlled, dynamic environment.
This tool complements the project's vision by enhancing traditional training methods, including academic curricula and industry-led guest lectures, with interactive, real-data-driven cyber range exercises. Hosted by CIRCL and supported by Restena's network interconnectivity, the infrastructure enables SkillAegis to play a pivotal role in preparing SOC operators for future challenges while fostering a collaborative and robust educational ecosystem.

On August 14, 2024, the release of \textbf{SkillAegis v1.0.0} was announced on misp-project.org. SkillAegis is an open-source platform developed as part of the NGSOTI project to advance cybersecurity training and capacity building. SkillAegis is designed to enhance cyber threat intelligence training through realistic, scenario-based exercises, enabling participants to simulate and respond to real-world cyber incidents.

\subsubsection{Key Features of SkillAegis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Scenario Creation:} Trainers can design customized exercises with specific learning objectives, simulating various cyber incidents to develop practical skills in threat intelligence and information management.
	\item \textbf{Exercise Execution \& Monitoring:} The platform allows trainers to deploy and oversee scenarios in real-time, using a live dashboard to track participant progress and provide immediate feedback.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Components of the SkillAegis Platform}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{SkillAegis Main Application:} Serves as the core component, managing scenario execution and integrating ready-to-use training modules.
	\item \textbf{SkillAegis Editor:} Enables trainers to create new exercises, including metadata, injects (tasks), execution order, and evaluation criteria. It also features an Inject Tester to optimize scenarios.
	\item \textbf{SkillAegis Dashboard:} Facilitates training session execution and provides real-time insights into participant progress, including completion status and logs of user actions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integration with MISP}
SkillAegis was specifically developed to integrate with MISP (Threat Sharing Platform), enhancing training quality. Injects can directly interact with data within MISP, querying and monitoring user activity. To enable this, SkillAegis connects to a training MISP instance via a valid site-admin API (Application Programming Interface) Key.

\subsection{MISP training Infrastructure}
MISP is a core element of the NGSOTI infrastructure, and stakeholders often request dedicated MISP training sessions. Since MISP is a fully distributed system, participants should be able to explore and experiment with data flow aspects. To facilitate this, a network of temporary MISP servers was set up for training purposes. These seven servers are publicly accessible, allowing participants to configure synchronization rules as needed. The deployment of the servers was fully automated, including their configuration with default user accounts for participants. After each training session, the servers are reset to provide new trainees with a clean environment. The deployment is managed using LXC technology. LXC (Linux Containers) is a lightweight virtualization technology that enables the creation of isolated environments on a single host by sharing the host's Linux kernel. Unlike traditional virtual machines, LXC containers are more resource-efficient and faster to start, as they don't require a separate operating system. They are ideal for use cases such as development, testing, training, and multi-tenancy, providing secure isolation and flexible resource management through namespaces and cgroups.


\subsection{Kunai}

While Linux workstations may not rival Windows or macOS systems in popularity, Linux systems dominate the server landscape, often hosting critical services such as web servers, databases, and many public systems accessible via the Internet. However, Linux security monitoring for Security Operation Centers (SOCs) frequently lacks the detailed visibility available on Windows systems, where free tools like Sysmon\footnote{\href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon}{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon}} exist. SOC engineers often rely on audit logs or application logs to create detection scenarios, but these sources are not always security-focused and typically lack correlation capabilities necessary for understanding the occurrence of suspicious events.

An attempt to port Microsoft Sysmon to Linux has been made\footnote{\href{https://github.com/microsoft/SysmonForLinux}{https://github.com/microsoft/SysmonForLinux}}. However, the project suffers from several Linux-specific design flaws and has not seen maintenance since its release, making it unappealing for potential users. Other projects, such as \textbf{Tracee}\footnote{\href{https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee}{https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee}} and \textbf{Falco}\footnote{\href{https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco}{https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco}}, address Linux security visibility issues but lack some key features offered by Sysmon, including threat-hunting capabilities and event correlation for root cause analysis.

From our experience, alert contextualization and root cause analysis are crucial for enabling SOC operators to triage alerts effectively and for incident responders to thoroughly investigate security events. These needs motivated the development of \textbf{Kunai}, with the goal of providing a tailored security visibility tool for Linux systems. Kunai empowers SOC engineers and incident responders to perform their jobs more effectively and efficiently.

As part of the \textbf{NGSOTI} project, Kunai has undergone significant enhancements to achieve its goals. Integration with \textbf{MISP}\footnote{\href{https://www.misp-project.org/}{https://www.misp-project.org/}} enables Kunai to leverage Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and threat intelligence shared through the platform. This fosters community-based intelligence sharing and simplifies the detection of known threats. Additionally, a rule engine was developed to facilitate log filtering and the creation of highly customizable detection rules tailored to specific needs and environments. The rule format was designed to be simple to write and share, promoting collaboration and distribution through platforms like \textbf{MISP}. These contributions make data sharing among SOCs seamless, allowing incidents to be detected and addressed more quickly.

Some of the other contributions made under \textbf{NGSOTI} include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Integration of numerous new security events, providing enhanced visibility, analysis, and detection capabilities.
	\item File scanning using \textbf{Yara}\footnote{\href{https://virustotal.github.io/yara-x/}{https://virustotal.github.io/yara-x/}} rules for malicious file detection.
	\item \textbf{Community-ID}\footnote{\href{https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec}{https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec}} support, enabling correlation between system logs and network logs from tools like \textbf{Suricata}\footnote{\href{https://suricata.io/}{https://suricata.io/}} and \textbf{Zeek}\footnote{\href{https://zeek.org/}{https://zeek.org/}}.
\end{itemize}

Finally, several production-readiness features have been implemented, such as automated installation and configuration and log rotation. Background tasks such as maintaining an up-to-date website and documentation\footnote{\href{https://why.kunai.rocks/}{https://why.kunai.rocks/}}, monitoring Linux kernel changes to reflect in the project, and refactoring code have also been undertaken to ensure the project's long-term reliability and relevance.


\chapter{NGSOTI Core Infrastructure}

NGSOTI Core Infrastrucutre encompassed the software stack that will be used for hosting the services and the datasets that trainees and trainers will have access to in the frame of the action. The core infrastructure has been deployed on the hardware procured for the action (see mgsoti-milestone3-report.pdf for more details):

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf{ngsoti1}} is a physical server that hosts LXC containers and that host the virtual training network,
	\item {\bf{ngsoti2}} is a physical server that hosts the datasets used during training (e.g. collections from the blackhole, malware samples, etc.)
	\item {\bf{ngsoti3}} is a physical server that host auxiliary GPU accelarated workloads (e.g. A.I webservices)
\end{itemize}



\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/NGSOTI-architecture.png}
	\caption{NGSOTI core infrastructure diagram}
	\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

The virtual training environment hosted on {\bf{ngsoti1}} is built around two main pieces of technology:

\begin{itemize}

	\item {\bf{LXC}} is a container runtime for
	      linux{\footnote{\url{https://linuxcontainers.org/}}}. It allows for the
	      creation of containers holding the differents services used during
	      trainings, as well as for the creation of a virtual network that users will
	      use to connect to the differents services. The LXC infrastructure offers
	      profiles that can be applied on newly created containers to easily create
	      SSH admin access, and mount datasets from {\bf{ngsoti2}}

	\item {\bf{tailscale}}{\footnote{\url{https://tailscale.com/}}} is a VPN
	      (Virtual Private Network) technology that allows us to give access to the
	      virtual network from anywhere where the tailscale client can run. In
	      addition to tailscale, we run
		      {\bf{headscale}}{\footnote{\url{https://headscale.net/stable/}}} that is an open
	      source project used to manage tailscale authentication.

\end{itemize}

As depicted on~\ref{fig1}, {\bf{ngsoti1}} holds a headscale LXC container to
manage the authentication of users, and Access Control Lists. Within the LXC
virtual network, there is a special LXC container that is also part of the
tailscale VPN (the tailnet) that acts as a router to the virtual training
infrastructure.

Eventually trainers, trainees, and admin alike can access the virutal training infrastructure throught the tailnet.

The documentation for each of these components is accessible in the project's internal notes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item overall architecture \url{https://github.com/ngsoti/internal-notes/blob/main/WP2/README.md}
	\item how to create containers \url{https://github.com/ngsoti/internal-notes/blob/main/WP2/containers.md}
	\item how to manage headscale \url{https://github.com/ngsoti/internal-notes/blob/main/WP2/headscale.md}
	\item how to onboard new admin user \url{https://github.com/ngsoti/internal-notes/blob/main/WP2/onboarding.md}
	\item how to manage the tailnet router \url{https://github.com/ngsoti/internal-notes/blob/main/WP2/tailnet-router.md}
\end{itemize}

Restena procured hardware for processing Blackhole data, set up the equipment in the data center, and initiated the first processing of the Blackhole data.
They also set up of a phishing platform to create phishing campaigns in the framework of the training activity.

\chapter{NGSOTI trainings}
Some EU regulations, such as NIS2 and DORA, have created a significant boost in the demand for NGSOTI training sessions. These sessions are designed to ensure organizations are well-prepared to meet the requirements of these regulations, which are often enforced starting in 2025. A key focus of these regulations is the establishment of local SOC (Security Operations Center).

The NIS2 Directive mandates that regulated entities implement robust incident response capabilities and maintain effective security operations. Specifically, organizations must establish comprehensive incident handling policies that define roles, responsibilities, and procedures for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents. These policies also cover post-incident activities such as recovery, documentation, and reporting.

Furthermore, the directive emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and logging of network and information systems to promptly detect and address potential threats. Entities are expected to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement automated monitoring where feasible.
	\item Regularly review logs to identify unusual activities.
	\item Ensure accurate time synchronization across systems to facilitate effective incident analysis.
\end{itemize}

By adhering to these requirements, organizations can enhance their resilience against cyber threats and ensure compliance with the NIS2 Directive. Article 21, under point (b), explicitly requires the establishment of incident handling capabilities.

Importantly, NIS2 extends its scope to include entities such as SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) involved in the supply chains of Operators of Essential Services (OES) or Digital Service Providers (DSP), which were not regulated under the original NIS Directive. These entities are now required to set up local incident response capabilities.

Given this regulatory landscape, the NGSOTI framework provided an excellent opportunity to conduct targeted incident response training. These efforts were aimed at equipping participants with the skills and knowledge required to comply with these critical regulations. The incident response trainings conducted are detailed in the table below:

Starting in the second semester of the academic year 2024-2025, NGSOTI
training activities will also be integrated into the Master in
Cybersecurity and Cyber Defence (MCYSD) programme at the University of
Luxembourg. These activities, delivered by cybersecurity professionals
from the NGSOTI consortium, will complement the existing MCYSD
curriculum by offering practical, industry-relevant courses, hands-on
exercises, and tailored lectures aligned with the latest regulatory
requirements and operational best practices. The specifics regarding
credits, teaching modalities, and schedules will be coordinated with the
University of Luxembourg's regulations, ensuring a comprehensive and
engaging learning experience for MCYSD students.


\chapter{NGSOTI research}
In terms of research, now that the infrastructure is in place, the core group
has begun using NGOSTI data to shape a focused research agenda.

Key directions include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Port Scanning Analysis: Investigate port scanning activities to
	      understand the evolving behavior and interests of attackers over time.
	\item Malware Propagation: Analyze malware spreading patterns and
	      generate actionable alerts. These alerts will be published and automated
	      through MISP to enhance threat intelligence sharing.
	\item Correlation with CVE Data: Connect scanning activity with the
	      Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database to identify
	      correlations between observed blackhole activity and newly published
	      vulnerabilities, particularly focusing on services of heightened interest.
	\item Threat Intelligence Integration: Combine blackhole data with MISP
	      threat intelligence feeds to provide a granular and contextualized view
	      of current threats. This will support the development of machine
	      learning (ML) models to predict potential attacks and threat trends.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{NGSOTI core working group activities}
This section describes the activities of the core working group as defined in the grant agreement. The purpose of the core working group is to ensure that the NGSOTI infrastructure and use cases are as closely aligned as possible with real-world requirements. In 2023, a subset of the core working group convened under the framework of CERT.lu, which brings together key SOC operators, ISPs, and CSIRTs/CERTs.
