# Our Experience and Key Takeaways from Trainings within the NGSOTI EU Funded Project

We are glad to share the overwhelmingly positive outcomes and valuable
insights gained from our participation in the [NGSOTI (Next Generation
Security Operations and Threat Intelligence) EU Funded
Project](https://github.com/ngsoti/). The project has been a resounding
success, allowing us to engage with a diverse audience and make
significant strides in cybersecurity education and training.

## A Resounding Success in Numbers

Throughout the project, we conducted **13 training sessions**, reaching
a total of **155 participants**. These participants hailed from a
variety of professional backgrounds, including the financial and
academic sectors, creating a rich and collaborative learning
environment.

## Tailored Training for the Financial Sector

One of our key observations was the effectiveness of providing
ready-to-use training materials for professionals in the financial
sector. Given the fast-paced and highly regulated nature of their work,
having access to practical, immediately applicable knowledge and tools
proved to be the most efficient and valuable approach.

## Bridging the Gap in Academia with Hands-On Tools

In the academic sector, we identified a clear need for more [practical,
hands-on tooling sessions for
students](https://github.com/ngsoti/ngsoti/tree/main/training). To
address this, our training for university students focused on Digital
Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) and Threat Intelligence,
utilizing cutting-edge open-source tools such as:

- **MISP - A Threat-Intelligence Platform**
- **AIL Project (Analysis Information Leak)**
- **Kunai**
- **FlowIntel**

The engagement and feedback from students were exceptional, highlighting
a strong desire for this type of practical experience.

## Rethinking University Curriculums: A Call for Practicality

Our experience within university settings also brought to light several
shortcomings in traditional academic approaches to cybersecurity
education:

- **Lack of Practical Labs:** There is a significant scarcity of
  hands-on laboratory sessions where students can apply theoretical
  knowledge.
- **Overemphasis on GRC:** Curriculums often focus heavily on
  Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) at the expense of practical,
  hands-on skills.
- **Onboarding Challenges:** We observed a learning curve for students
  who were not accustomed to hands-on lab environments.

These observations point to a tremendous opportunity for universities to
rethink and modernize their cybersecurity curriculums. By incorporating
more practical, tool-based training, we can better prepare the next
generation of cybersecurity professionals for the real-world challenges
they will face.

# Conclusion

The NGSOTI project has been a rewarding experience. It has not only
allowed us to share our expertise but has also provided us with
invaluable insights into the diverse needs of the cybersecurity
community. We are more committed than ever to championing hands-on,
practical training and look forward to continuing to bridge the gap
between theoretical knowledge and real-world application.
